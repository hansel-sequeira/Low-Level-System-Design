/**
 *
 *
 * Threads -> fundamental unit of execution in Java. It allows for processing concurrent tasks thereby creating responsive
 * applications, utilizing multi cores effectively and improving overall application performance.
 *
 *  Process -> is a executable instance of a program. It can contain one or many threads. It has its own dedicated
 *  memory space and the overhead in creating a new process is pretty high. IPC requires complex mechanisms, and context switching
 *  is also pretty expensive. One process crash doesn't typically impact other processes. Hence, if you need strong isolation
 *  between different parts of your application, create new processes.
 *
 *  Thread -> fundamental unit of execution a process. Threads of a process share the same memory and resources. Overhead to create
 *  a new thread is lighter and communication is easy since they share memory. Context switching also is a lower overhead.
 *  Impacts to a thread could impact the entire process.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Two ways to create a thread in java -> extending the thread class, implementing the runnable interface.
 *
 * There's also a callable interface which is somewhat better than the runnable interface (which returns void).
 * The Callable interface can return results and throw checked exceptions through the call() method.
 * (Unchecked exceptions can be thrown from either thread, runnable or callable)
 * Callable returns a Future object using which you can retrieve the execution result. To spawn a Callable thread,
 * you need to pass the callable implementation to an ExecutorService framework.
 *
 *
 * Exceptions do not propagate to the parent thread.
